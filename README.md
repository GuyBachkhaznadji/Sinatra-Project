Gladiators will assigned a creature and can fight a creature.

MVP
* CRUD actions for creatures/fighters
* Mark creatures as being fightable/not fightable
* Assign a creature to a new fighter
* List all the fighters and the creatures they will fight

Possible Extensions
* Have separate pages for creatures ready for fighting and ones still in training/vet care
* filter for creatures by breed/type
* Filter for animals based on power / level or something similar
* CSS - Make it look cool

LAST EXTENSION IF HAVE TIME
* Add a fight element with game fighting logic (variable in a range with a random element to reduce health of animal / owner)
* Any other ideas you might come up with
