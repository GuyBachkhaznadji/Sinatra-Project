# Sinatra-Project

Magical Roman Arena
This is a Ruby Sinatra CRUD web app using a RESTful API and PostgreSQL.
TDD to be used for all non SQL methods. 
There are creatures in the Arena.
Gladiators will assigned a creature and can fight a creature.

MVP
* CRUD actions for creatures/fighters.
* Mark creatures as being fightable/not fightable.
* Assign a creature to a new fighter.
* List all the fighters and the creatures they will fight.
* SQL injection prevention measures for all database interactions.

Possible Extensions
* Have separate pages for creatures ready for fighting and ones still in training/vet care.
* CSS - Make it look cool.
* Mobile first responsive design
* Accessible first design - clear English, high contract text, easy to read font, semantic HTML, Alt tags on images and labels on forms.
* filter for creatures by breed/type.
* Filter for animals based on power / level or something similar.


LAST EXTENSION IF HAVE TIME
* Add a fight element with game fighting logic (variable in a range with a random element to reduce health of animal / owner).
* Any other ideas you might come up with.
